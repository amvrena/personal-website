			<hr>
			<p style = "text-align: left;">As of now, I am doing digital arts during my leisure time. 
			It also serves as a coping mechanism whenever I feel down. Thought, I started drawing traditionally first. 
			I am also into watching animated series, as seen from the layout of this website, and I have been watching them
			ever since I was a kid; and served as a catalyst to hone my drawing skills.<br>
			I started to take a liking on novels when I decided to borrow a book from a classmate because I was bored that time. 
			Since then, I hope to purchase and read as many books as I can. Although electronic books will do, it is still different when 
			you have an actual book in your hands.</br></p>
